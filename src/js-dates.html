      <h1>Dates in JavaScript</h1>
      <p>
        Dates are an essential part of web development, and JavaScript provides
        a built-in Date object to work with dates and times. This guide will
        cover the basics of working with dates in JavaScript, including creating
        and formatting dates, as well as performing common operations such as
        calculating the difference between dates and working with time zones.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        JavaScript dates are a way to work with dates and times in your code. A
        date in JavaScript is an object that represents a moment in time. These
        date objects can show you the year, month, day, hour, minute, second,
        and even milliseconds.
      </p>
      </div>

      <div>
      <h2>Dates in JavaScript Are Essential for Coding</h2>
      <p>
        Dates in JavaScript are used for handling and manipulating dates and
        times in your code. They are essential for many different purposes.
        Here's what they are commonly used for:
      </p>
      </div>

    <div>
      <ul>
        <h3>1. Displaying Dates and Times:</h3>
        <li>
          You can show the current date and time to users, or display dates and
          times stored in databases. This is common in web applications and
          forms.  
        </li>

        <h3>2. Calculating Time Intervals:</h3>
        <li>
          You might want to find the difference between two dates, like the
          number of days until a deadline or the time since an event occurred. 

        </li>

        <h3>3. Logging and Timestamps:</h3>
        <li>
          Dates are important for creating timestamps in logs to track when
          events happen in your application. This is useful for debugging and
          monitoring. 
        </li>

        <h3>4. Handling User Input:</h3>
        <li>
          When users input dates (like birthdates, appointments, etc.),
          JavaScript dates help parse, validate, and use these dates. 
        </li>

        <h3>5. Time Zone Adjustments:</h3>
        <li>
          JavaScript Date objects can be used to handle and display dates and
          times in different time zones. This is important for international
          applications.
        </li>

        <h3>6. Date Arithmetic:</h3>
        <li>
          You might need to add or subtract time from a date, like calculating a
          due date or expiry date. JavaScript dates can help with these kinds of
          calculations. 
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

        <h2>Understanding JavaScript Date Objects</h2>
        <p>
          The JavaScript Date object is used to work with dates and times. It
          provides methods for creating, formatting, and manipulating dates. The
          Date object is a data type built into the JavaScript language. It is
          used to create instances of dates and times, and to work with these
          instances. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          The Date object is a static object, meaning that it can be accessed
          directly without creating an instance of the Date object. The Date
          object is used to work with dates and times in JavaScript. It provides
          methods for creating, formatting, and manipulating dates. The Date
          object is a data type built into the JavaScript language. It is used
          to create instances of dates and times, and to work with these
          instances.  The Date object is a static object, meaning that it can be
          accessed directly without creating an instance of the Date object.

        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Date Object Creation</h2>
        <ul>
          <h3>Current Date & Time:</h3>
            <li>`new Date()`- creates a Date object with the current date and time.</li>
          <h3>Specific Date & Time:</h3>
            <li>`new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes,
            seconds, milliseconds)` - lets you specify each component. Note that
            month is 0-indexed (0 for January, 1 for February, etc.).</li>
          <h3>Timestamp:</h3>
            <li>`new Date(milliseconds)` - creates a date based on the number of
            milliseconds since January 1, 1970. </li>
          <h3>Date String:</h3> 
            <li>`new Date(dateString)`
            creates a date based on a string format, like "2023-03-01".</li>
        </ul>
        

        
        <ul>
        <h2>Getting Date Components:</h2>
        <h3>Year:</h3>
          <li>getFullYear() returns the 4-digit year.</li> 
        <h3>Month:</h3> 
          <li>`getMonth()` - returns the month (0-11). </li> 
        <h3>Day of Month:</h3> 
          <li>`getDate()` - returns the day (1-31). </li>
        <h3>Day of Week:</h3>
          <li>`getDay()` - returns the day of the week (0 for
          Sunday, 1 for Monday, etc.).</li>    
        <h3>Hours, Minutes, Seconds, Milliseconds:</h3>
          <li>Accessed by `getHours()`, `getMinutes()`, `getSeconds()`, `getMilliseconds()`.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
        <h3>Setting Date Components:</h3>
        <l1>Similar to the 'get' methods, there are 'set' methods like
          `setFullYear(year)`, `setMonth(month)`, `setDate(day)`, `setHours(hours)`,
          etc.</l1>
          <li>These methods change the corresponding part of the Date object.</l1>
        </ul>

        <ul>
        <h3>String Representation/Formatting Dates:</h3>
         <li>`toString()`- converts the date to a string in a readable format.</li>
          <li>`toLocaleDateString()`- provides a localized date string.</li> 
          <li>`toISOString()` - gives an ISO formatted string.</li>
          <li>`toUTCString()` - returns a UTC date string.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
        <h3>Date Arithmetic and Comparison:</h3>
        <li>Dates can be added using the `set` methods, which change the
          corresponding part of the Date object. Dates can be subtracted, returning
          the difference in milliseconds. To compare dates, convert them to numeric
          values (e.g., `date1.getTime() === date2.getTime()`).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Calculating Date Differences</h2>
        <p>
          You can calculate the difference between two dates by subtracting them
          from each other. This will give you the difference in milliseconds. You
          can then convert this to other units (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours,
          days) as needed.  
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <ul>
      
        <h3>Time Zones:</h3>
        <li>JavaScript Date objects can handle time zones, but it's important to
          be aware of the limitations and complexities involved. The Intl.DateTimeFormat
          object can be used to format dates and times in a specific time zone.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <ul>
        <h3>Working with Dates:</h3>
        <li>Working with dates in JavaScript can be complex, especially when
          dealing with time zones and internationalization. It's important to be
          aware of the limitations and complexities involved in working with dates
          in JavaScript, and to use the appropriate tools and libraries to handle
          dates and times in your applications.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
